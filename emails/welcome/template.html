Welcome, brave adventurer, to <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">HabitRPG</a>! We’re glad to have you journeying alongside us in the battle for self-improvement.

<br><br>

Here are some helpful tips as you navigate the land of Habitica:

<ul>
  <li>Wondering where to begin? The wiki has a great page on <a href="http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Establishing_Your_Tasks">Establishing Your Tasks</a>!</li>
  <li>Start slow! If you immediately fill your account with tons of tasks, you may crash and burn. Try adding just a few tasks in each category, and then challenging yourself further as you master them!</li>
  <li>Make <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">HabitRPG</a> a bookmark or homepage so you remember to check your tasks!</li>
  <li>If you’ve got a question, head to the <a href="*|BASE_URL|*/#/options/groups/guilds/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a">Newbies Guild</a>, where other adventurers in the quest for life improvement ask and answer questions! You can also read the <a href="http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ">FAQ</a>.</li>
</ul>

There are plenty of exciting features to unlock as you level up your real life. Soon you’ll be earning pets, choosing armor, and even battling monsters as you achieve your everyday goals. We look forward to seeing your success!

<br><br>

Stay productive,
<br>
Tyler, Vicky, and Leslie
