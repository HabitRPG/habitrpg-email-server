Hi *|RECIPIENT_NAME|*! 

*|INVITER|* would like you to join their party on HabitRPG (*|LINK|*), a game to help you improve your real-life habits! 

Together, you can keep each other accountable for your goals while battling monsters and leveling up your avatars. It doesn’t matter if you’re flossing more or finishing that big assignment – either way, you’ll be earning gold, hatching pets, and unlocking weapons!

What are you waiting for? Come adventure at *|INVITER|*’s side! Go to *|LINK|*

Stay productive,
Tyler, Vicky, and Leslie
