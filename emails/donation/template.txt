Dear generous adventurer,

Thank you so much for donating to HabitRPG! With the gold you have given us, we’ll be able to feed the server beasts, smite down snarling bugs, and construct fun new features together. In short, you’re fantastic!

We hope that you enjoy your shiny new gems! There are many ways to spend them - on Backgrounds and aesthetic features; on changing your class to collect more equipment; or on creating Guilds and Challenges for your fellow Habiticans. We look forward to seeing what you decide to do.

Have a wonderful and productive day!

Stay productive,
Tyler, Vicky, and Leslie
