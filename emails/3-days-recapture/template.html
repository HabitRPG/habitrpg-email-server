Greetings, adventurer!

<br><br>

Remember <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">HabitRPG</a>, the site that lets you treat your life like a game? We’ve noticed that you haven’t checked in for a few days. Don’t let your avatar die by neglecting your tasks!

<br><br>

If you did your tasks but are having trouble remembering to check in, we recommend setting <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">HabitRPG</a> as a bookmark or home page. Additionally, <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/212565-habitrpg-daily-reminder">here’s an IFTTT Recipe</a> that can remind you to check off your Dailies every night, and <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/190950-remind-me-every-morning-to-update-habitrpg">another</a> that can remind you to check in each morning. (Both were created by talented users!) This <a href="http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Burnout">wiki page</a> also has tips on staying motivated!

<br><br>

Besides, there are lots of exciting things in your future. Unlocking new armor and weapons by level 2 is just the beginning. At level 4, you’ll unlock the drops system, with every completed task giving you a chance at eggs, potions, and food, which you can use to get pets and mounts!

<br>

Plus, at level 10 you’ll get the option to become a Warrior, Rogue, Mage, or Healer, all while making real-life progress! 

<br><br>

Come join us! There are monsters to slay and lives to improve.

<br><br>

Stay productive,
<br>
Tyler, Vicky, and Leslie
