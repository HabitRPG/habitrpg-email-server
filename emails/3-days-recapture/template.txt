Greetings, adventurer!

Remember HabitRPG, the site that lets you treat your life like a game? We’ve noticed that you haven’t checked in for a few days. Don’t let your avatar die by neglecting your tasks!

If you did your tasks but are having trouble remembering to check in, we recommend setting HabitRPG as a bookmark or home page. Additionally, here’s an IFTTT Recipe (https://ifttt.com/recipes/212565-habitrpg-daily-reminder) that can remind you to check off your Dailies every night, and another (https://ifttt.com/recipes/190950-remind-me-every-morning-to-update-habitrpg) that can remind you to check in each morning. (Both were created by talented users!) This wiki page (http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Burnout) also has tips on staying motivated!

Besides, there are lots of exciting things in your future. Unlocking new armor and weapons by level 2 is just the beginning. At level 4, you’ll unlock the drops system, with every completed task giving you a chance at eggs, potions, and food, which you can use to get pets and mounts! 

Plus, at level 10 you’ll get the option to become a Warrior, Rogue, Mage, or Healer, all while making real-life progress! 

Come join us! There are monsters to slay and lives to improve.

Stay productive,
Tyler, Vicky, and Leslie
