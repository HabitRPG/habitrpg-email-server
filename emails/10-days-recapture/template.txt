Greetings, adventurer!

It’s been a while since you’ve checked in to HabitRPG - we understand that life can get busy! But we have to make sure that we try our best to keep you engaged, of course, so we can check off that “Retain Awesome User” To-Do!

Did you know that HabitRPG has a social side? Like all good MMORPGs, it’s more fun to play with friends, so you should definitely consider starting or joining a party (http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Party). Looking for a group? Check out the Archery (http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Board:The_Archery_-_LFG)!

There are also excellent Guilds (*|BASE_URL|*/#/options/groups/guilds/public) that you can join to chat with other like-minded people and encourage each other to stay motivated.

Finally, have you explored our list of Challenges (*|BASE_URL|*/#/options/groups/challenges)? By joining a Challenge, you can add assigned tasks to your account and compete to win gems as you improve your life! 

We hope to see you back soon! Habitica isn’t the same without you.

Stay productive,
Tyler, Vicky, and Leslie
