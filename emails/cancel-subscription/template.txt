Dear generous adventurer,

We were saddened to learn that you will no longer be subscribing to HabitRPG, but we understand that circumstances can easily change. For this reason, as we wave goodbye, we want to extend our sincere thanks to you for choosing to subscribe.

During your period as a subscriber, no matter how long or short, you helped us to provide HabitRPG for free. Your patronage assisted us with bug fixes, let us build new features, and allowed us to feed the hungry server beasts for another month. So thank you - your generosity and kindness have meant the world to us.

We hope to one day have your patronage again. Until then, we look forward to seeing you around the site.

Stay productive,
Tyler, Vicky, and Leslie
