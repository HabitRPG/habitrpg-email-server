Greetings, adventurer!
 
<br><br>

Remember <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">HabitRPG</a>, the website that turns your real life into a game? We’ve just launched our Spring Fling event and given everyone a free Egg Hunt collection quest! Motivate yourself and your friends to find eggs by completing your real-life tasks, and you’ll be rewarded with <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">Egg pets and mounts</a>!

<br>

<br>

Also, <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">on the website</a> we have brand-new, limited edition class equipment available to purchase with gold from the Rewards column! These items will disappear on April 30th, so you’ll have to be extra-productive to earn them all in time. Depending on your class, you can be a Magician’s Bunny, Comforting Kitty, Beware Dog, or Sneaky Squeaker! <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">Come check them out!</a>

<br>
 
So what are you waiting for?  <a href="https://habitrpg.com">Come get organized, get motivated, and get some gold</a>! We’re looking forward to seeing you again.
 
<br><br>

Warmly,<br>
Tyler, Leslie, and Vicky<br>
