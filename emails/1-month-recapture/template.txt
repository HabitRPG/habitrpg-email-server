Greetings, adventurer!

Remember HabitRPG, the website that turns your real life into a game? We’ve just launched our Spring Fling event and given everyone a free Egg Hunt collection quest! Motivate yourself and your friends to find eggs by completing your real-life tasks, and you’ll be rewarded with Egg pets and mounts (*|BASE_URL|*)!

Also, on the website we have brand-new, limited edition class equipment available to purchase with gold from the Rewards column! These items will disappear on April 30th, so you’ll have to be extra-productive to earn them all in time. Depending on your class, you can be a Magician’s Bunny, Comforting Kitty, Beware Dog, or Sneaky Squeaker! Come check them out! (*|BASE_URL|*)

Warmly,
Tyler, Leslie, and Vicky
