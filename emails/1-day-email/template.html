Greetings, adventurer!

<br><br>

In honor of your second day with us, <b>we wanted to share 5 easy tricks to help you get the most from <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">HabitRPG</a></b>.

<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Make HabitRPG.com a home page/bookmark.</b><br>
    Our users tell us that this is their favorite method to help them remember to check in every day!
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Set alarms.</b><br>
    If you don’t complete your Dailies before the end of your day, they will hurt you! Set an alarm to remember to check them off. 
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Check out the website as well as the mobile app.</b><br>
    Our website has more features, a tutorial, and lots of other great stuff! We’re working on rewriting our mobile apps to be native, but until then, <a href="*|BASE_URL|*">take a peek at the website</a>. Check out this screenshot for a sample:<br>

  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Use the Data Display Tool</b><br>
    Clicking the “Data” tab or going to <a href="https://oldgods.net/habitrpg/habitrpg_user_data_display.html">data.habitrpg.com</a> will show you how much damage your Dailies will cause, which To-Dos you forgot to tag, and more!
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Join the Newbies Guild</b><br>
    If you’ve got any questions, join the <a href="https://habitrpg.com/#/options/groups/guilds/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a">Newbies Guild!</a> It’s a great place to ask questions.     
  </li>
</ul>

If you use these tips and tricks, it’ll really help your experience in the land of Habitica.

Stay productive,
