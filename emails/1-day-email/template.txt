Greetings, adventurer!

In honor of your second day with us, we wanted to share 5 easy tricks to help you get the most from HabitRPG (*|BASE_URL|*).

1. Make HabitRPG.com a home page/bookmark.
  Our users tell us that this is their favorite method to help them remember to check in every day!
2. Set alarms.
  If you don’t complete your Dailies before the end of your day, they will hurt you! Set an alarm to remember to check them off. 
3. Check out the website as well as the mobile app.
  Our website has more features, a tutorial, and lots of other great stuff! We’re working on rewriting our mobile apps to be native, but until then, take a peek at the website (*|BASE_URL|*). 
  Check out this screenshot for a sample: https://habitrpg.com/emails/images/one-day-v1.png
4. Use the Data Display Tool
  Clicking the “Data” tab or going to data.habitrpg.com will show you how much damage your Dailies will cause, which To-Dos you forgot to tag, and more!
5. Join the Newbies Guild
  If you’ve got any questions, join the Newbies Guild (https://habitrpg.com/#/options/groups/guilds/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a)! It’s a great place to ask questions.

If you use these tips and tricks, it’ll really help your experience in the land of Habitica.

Stay productive,
Tyler, Vicky, and Leslie
